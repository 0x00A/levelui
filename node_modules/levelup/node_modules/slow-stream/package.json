  "readme": "# node-slow-stream\n\nA throttleable stream, for working in the slow-lane; i.e. good for testing when you need things to slow down. Available in npm as *slow-stream*\n\n## Example\n\n```js\nvar fs = require('fs')\n  , SlowStream = require('slow-stream')\n\nfs.createReadStream('infile', { bufferSize: 64 })\n  .pipe(new SlowStream({ maxWriteInterval: 5 }))\n  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('outfile'))\n```\n\nThrottling is performed on a per-write basis, so in this example the `ReadStream` from the file is writing 64-byte chunks at a time. The `SlowStream` is only allowing them through at a rate of one per 5ms.\n\nBack-pressure is properly applied so if you're working with properly implemented streams you shouldn't run into memory issues.\n\n## Contributing\n\nTests can be run with `npm test`. I'm more than happy to receive contributions so fork away!\n\n## Copyright and licence\n\n*Copyright (c) 2012 [Rod Vagg](https://github.com/rvagg) ([@rvagg](https://twitter.com/rvagg))*\n\nMade available under the MIT licence:\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished\nto do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
